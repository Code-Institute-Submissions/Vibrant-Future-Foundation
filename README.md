![image](assets/images/responsive-image.jpg)
## **Purpose/Aim**

Raise awareness about the vulnerable communities of elderly and children who are less fortunate and without any support from their family or close relatives.
These peoples are in difficulties, negleted and unable to be self sufficient due to poverty, illness, disability and even wars. "Vibrant Future Foundation"
was originally formed to provide help, aids and any possible support for both financially and mentally to those vulnerable people around the world and specially
in underdeveloped and poor countries.

With this aim in mind, I have decided to build this website as a platform to support the foundation so that we can grab more attentions and
receiving greater/wider support from the various people and corporations as well as possible future collaborations.

Main purpose of this website is to let people around us to know about this foundation and at the same time to plant awareness
of real social issues in the communities and broader societies.
Also, share the information on how we help people and no matter what the size of the support from everyone, big or small, would
be valuable and appreciated act of kindness so that more people will engage and be attracted with our aims and we can extensively
help people around the world.

## Issues and Resolutions

#### The following issues were identified and resolved throughout the build process.

  - Text inside the Join Us button on the Home page had an issue as text not align properly, same class was used and same style applied in css for both Join now and Donate button however donate button did not show any issue and only join us button shown an issue.
    - Issue fixed by changing height of button to auto.

  - While inspecting on iPad pro display using dev tool, most of the content shrink and resulted excess white space below the footer section of Who We Are and Join Us pages.
    - Issue was fixed by using media query, min-width and max-width values used in media query to target only iPad Pro display.

  - There was also an excess white space on the bottom of content section of all pages except home page while display switched to iPad Pro.
    - Issue was fixed by adding border-bottom value to all content container in style.css : border-bottom value set to double for all IDs 
    relevant to the content containers of the pages which fixed the issue.

  - Text overflow issue on What We Do page as text overlay on all 3 images overflown from those images while switching display to extra small screen size.
    - Issue was fixed by using media query - font size of the texts reduced for extra small screen size using media query, which fixed the issue.

  - Margin issue with phone and mail icon in front of the contact number and email address on media section of Join Us page which cause icon and text displayed very close and no space between one another, same codes were used on all pages and no similar issue noticed, however only Join Us page identified with this issue.
    - Missing mr-2 class to the i elements on join.html page, issue fixed once added mr-2 class.

  - Slightly noticable whitespace below footer on 'Who We Are' page while switching display to iPad which could be just an optical illusion or any possible error.
    - Issue not yet resolved.

  - While I ran Lightouse using dev tool, Home page has performance score below 90% which I was not satisfied as the aim was to score above 90% as the bare minimum.
    - Issue could not addressed further : as per Lighthouse recommendation, I tried to [compress the image](assets/images/compressed-image.JPG) however I could not get the desire image in terms of quality and size after compression therefore could not make improvement as image was tested across all devices and no issue identified in terms of image loading time.
    Also, lower score in Lighthouse report was caused by [vendor scripts](assets/images/lighthouse-issue.jpg) added to my page (Bootstrap, Fontawesome etc) which was not possible to be removed from the page. 
  
  - **Internet Explorer** showed an issue on Home page, while testing the page, [Content of the home page and logo did not display correctly](assets/images/homepage.jpg) in the centre, instead displayed vertically.
    Also, Donate and Sign up forms showed an [issue with placeholder text](assets/images/modal.jpg) as placeholder text not displaying correctly, gallery section on the What We Do page which trigger by button below images also showed large excess space below images.
    - Issue not yet resolved

  - **Mozilla Firefox** **Internet Explorer** showed an issue with images on What We Do page as blur-effect that used on image did not work.
    - After reaching out with tutor support, mentor and doing my own reaserach I have found that backdrop-filter property that I initially used in my style.css for blur effect only supported on **Google Chrom** which resulted diffrent outcome on page while viewing on **Mozilla Firefox**, **Internet Explorer** and also on **iPad** . I have therefore removed backdrop-filter property from my style.css, instead i have used background property and add background of #495057cc to image-overlay class which ressolved an issue.  
 
  -  Small [horizontal line](assets/images/social-icon-error.jpg) appears next to bottom-right of each social media icons of the page while hovering over those icons, which i did not add neither i wanted those to be appear.
    - Issue fixed by adding text decoration property in style.css to the social media icons : text-decoration value set to none which fixed an issue.

    ```
    .list-inline-social a  {
    text-decoration: none;
    }
    ```
