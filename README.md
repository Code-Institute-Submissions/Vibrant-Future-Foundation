Raise awareness of the vulnerable communities of elderly and children who are less fortunate and without any support from their family or close relatives. 
These peoples are in difficulties , negleted and unable to be self sufficient due to poverty, sickness, disability and wars."Vibrant Future Foundation"
was originally formed to provide help and any possible support , both financially and mentally to those vulnerable people around the world and specially 
in underdevelop and poor country. 

With this in mind i have decided to build the mock-up website as a platform to support the foundation so that we can grab more attentions from the people.
Main purpose of this website is to let people around us to know about this foundation, how we help people and how small support from everyone would
be such a valuable thing so that more people will engage with our aim and we can extensively 
help people around the world.
