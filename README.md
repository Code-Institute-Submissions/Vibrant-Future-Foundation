# **Vibrant Future Foundation**

## **Purpose/Aim**

Raise awareness about the vulnerable communities of elderly and children who are less fortunate and without any support from their family or close relatives.
These peoples are in difficulties, negleted and unable to be self sufficient due to poverty, illness, disability and even wars. "Vibrant Future Foundation"
was originally formed to provide help, aids and any possible support for both financially and mentally to those vulnerable people around the world and specially
in underdeveloped and poor country.

With this aim in mind, I have decided to build this mock-up website as a platform to support the foundation so that we can grab more attentions and
receiving greater/wider support from the various people and corporations as well as possible future collaborations.

Main purpose of this website is to let people around us to know about this foundation and at the same time to plant awareness
of real social issues in the communities and broader societies.
Also, share the information on how we help people and no matter what the size of the support, big or small, from everyone would
be such a valuable and appreciated act of kindness so that more people will engage and be attracted with our aim and we can extensively
help people around the world.
