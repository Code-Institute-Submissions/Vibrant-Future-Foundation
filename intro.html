              It was an evening of 16th June 2016 and we were gathered in
              Hampstead park in North London for social sports as usual to play
              football and cricket sports after we finished our work. After few
              hours of sport, we were just having some relaxed time and friendly
              conversation in the park. Somehow our conversation directed
              towards very different topics and we started talking about the
              people’s life and difficulties in the under-developing countries
              around the world. It was almost 9 PM and after almost 3 hour-long
              conversation about the people and lifestyle of Nepal and other
              under-developed countries around the world, we had many opinions
              and arguments, finally we all came to the conclusion that indeed
              there are many people in those countries who desperately need help
              and support to lift their lives as well as homeless, people who
              live in poverty and illness. We all have heard and even seen about
              the life stories of those people on TV, radio or newspapers, but
              it seems that very minimum action taken to support, hundreds and
              thousands of funds collect as the name of charity and directly and
              indirectly many charity organisation have been working in various
              places around the world but surprisingly peoples were always there
              on the street and their situation is really devastating.<br />All
              of us had spent our early life in Nepal and we have closely seen
              thousands of people on daily basis who were just struggling to
              survive, most of them were either disabled or children/elderly and
              orphan. Of Course, it is not anyone’s responsibility to support
              them who are in real need but as a human being we found this as an
              incredibly sad and emotional thing to see people in such a bad
              situation.<br />
              We then start thinking about how we can support those who are in
              real need situation, finally we conclude to involve ourselves in
              helping them in whichever way we can and whatever it takes for us
              to do so, we all had responsibility towards own life, bills and
              family loan to pay therefore it was very essential for us to work
              as much as we can and earn money however we strongly agreed that
              if we can cut down any small expense from ourselves and do some
              extra work to contribute towards the charity.<br />we were very
              determined and commited on this since then so as a initial step we
              decided to contribute £40 every months from our own pocket and
              established the charity fund.<br />
              Our passion of ‘pay it forward’ leads us to crunch our brains
              together to perform act of kindness, show generosity and helping
              the communities and societies they live in. The religions believe
              by us have taught us about
              <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma"
                >Laws of Karma</a
              >
              and we are reaching out to perform the positive actions and
              thoughts on our daily lives. This Foundation is established as
              medium to facilitate the charitable donations and volunteering
              activities lead by us to provide various supports to the targeted
              groups of vulnerable people within the societies and communities.
              In addition, friends and colleagues of the us are connected and
              collaborate together to provide mouth-to-mouth publicities and
              allowing wider communities to donate and support through this
              Foundation.<br />
              The logo of foundation was carefully designed with ideas
              contribution from all of us to meet the purposes and goals of this
              Foundation. Stars in the logo symbolized divine force or energy
              which represent the main purpose of this Foundation to bring
              positive vibes to the people-in-need. Rainbow is the sign of hope
              and faith in various believes and this Foundation is trying to
              rise up the solidarity feelings among the people to perform act of
              kindness everywhere. The hand is displaying humble backgrounds of
              us and our nature to always ready for lending our helping hands.
              The main colour of this Foundation is green which symbolizes
              harmony, growth and relaxation which lead towards strong emotional
              correspondence with safety which we are trying to give and share
              with the vulnerable people.
