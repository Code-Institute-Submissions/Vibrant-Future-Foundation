                            Our Journey began on 16th June 2016 when the four of us gathered in
                            Hampstead Park in North London for social sports as usual to play
                            football and cricket after we finished our work. After few
                            hours of doing sport, we had some relax time and friendly
                            conversation in the park. Somehow our conversation directed
                            towards very different topics and we started talking about the
                            people’s lives and difficulties in the underdeveloped countries
                            around the world. It was almost 9 PM and after almost 3 hour-long
                            conversation about the people and lifestyle in Nepal and other
                            underdeveloped countries around the world, we had many opinions
                            and arguments. Finally, we all came to the conclusion that indeed
                            there are many people in those countries who desperately need help
                            and support to lift up their lives, people who
                            live in poverty, illness and even homeless communities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of us had spent our early life in Nepal and we had closely
                            seen thousands of people on daily basis who struggled
                            to survive, most of them were either disabled, children, elderly
                            and orphan. Of course, we can argue that it is not our responsibility to
                            support them however as human being with emotions and feelings, we found
                            these facts incredibly sad and devastating to see people in such a bad situation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We then started thinking and came up with various plans on how we can support and help those 
                            who are in-need, finally we concluded to involve ourselves in
                            helping them in whichever way we can think or execute and whatever it takes for us
                            to do so, we all had responsibility towards our own lives, bills and
                            family loan to pay therefore it was very essential for us to work
                            as much as we can and earn money however, we strongly agreed that we can
                            cut down various small expenses from ourselves and do some
                            extra works to contribute towards the Foundation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We were very determined and committed to this Foundation and as our very
                            initial step, we decided to contribute £40 every month from our
                            own pockets and established the charity fund which now well known with 'FUND AS WE GO' service.

                        <p>
                            Our passion of ‘pay it forward’ leads us to crunch our brains
                            together to perform act of kindness, show generosity and helping
                            the communities and societies we live in. Our religions or beliefs
                            have taught us about
                            <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma">Laws of Karma</a>
                            and we are reaching out to perform the positive actions and
                            thoughts on our daily lives. This Foundation is established as
                            medium to facilitate the charitable donations and volunteering
                            activities lead by us to provide various supports to the targeted
                            groups of vulnerable people within the societies and communities.
                            In addition, our friends and colleagues are connected and
                            collaborate together to provide mouth-to-mouth publicities which
                            allow wider communities to donate and support through this
                            Foundation.

                        <p>
                            The logo of the Foundation was carefully designed with ideas
                            contributed from all of us to meet the purposes and goals of this
                            Foundation. Stars in the logo symbolized divine force or energy
                            which represent the main purpose of this Foundation to bring
                            positive vibes to the people-in-need. Rainbow is the sign of hope
                            and faith in various beliefs and this Foundation is trying to
                            rise up the solidarity feelings among the people to perform act of
                            kindness everywhere. The hand is displaying humble backgrounds of
                            us and our nature to always ready for lending our helping hands.
                            The main colour of this Foundation is green which symbolizes
                            harmony, growth and relaxation which lead towards strong emotional
                            correspondence with safety which we are trying to provide and share
                            with the vulnerable people.
