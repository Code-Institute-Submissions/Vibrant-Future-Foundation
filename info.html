				The Founders believe on the philosophy of "The starting point of all achievements is desire." The act of
				kindness and contribution
				no matter how small nor significant can lead to broader and wider targets as well as able to reach out
				even to the most remote areas where people
				live vulnerably and in dangers. Emphasising on these critical social issues and cases, such as poverty,
				illness, disability, and education,
				help the Founders focus on tackling the matters accurately.<br>
                The support, aid and helps we provided are made to happen by various interesting and enjoyable activities in life.
                In addition to these, we are grateful and appreciate the trust given by the communities and societies where it allows the Founders to keep pursuing
                their dreams and desires to continue make differences and impacts to the lives of the identified vulnerable people.
